Part 1 Shapefiles
  Add both shapefiles into ArcMap
  Use the geoprocessing tool MERGE
  Input the two layers - statewide and tarrant
  Result - One shapefile of the entire state
  
Part 2 Mapping 
  Join csv file data to the new state layer
  In Symbology - Use Quantities- Graduated Colors to display unregistered democrats by precinct 
  In the future I would use Arcgis Pro or ArcGIS online to create an interactive map in order better visualize areas like Dallas, Houston, Austin etc.
  
Part 3 Calculating Centroids
  I used the Zonal Geometry as Table (Spatial Analyst)
  This tool calculates the geometry measures (area, perimeter, thickness, and the characteristics of ellipse) for each zone in a dataset and reports the results as a table.
  Input Zone Layer - State Layer
  Zone Field - dnc_precin
  Ouput - csv file
